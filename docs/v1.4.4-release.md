# v1.4.4 Release Notes

## New Features

### Account Abstraction (AA) Wallet Support — `txHashResolver`

Added support for Account Abstraction wallets (e.g. **ZeroDev**, **Dynamic Global Wallet**) via a new optional `txHashResolver` configuration parameter.

#### Problem

When using AA wallets, `writeContract` returns a **UserOperation hash** instead of a standard **transaction hash**. The SDK's `waitForTransactionReceipt` only works with regular transaction hashes, causing AA wallet transactions to fail silently or hang.

#### Solution

A new `txHashResolver` option can be passed when creating a `StoryClient`. This function resolves UserOperation hashes into on-chain transaction hashes before the SDK waits for receipts. The resolver is applied transparently — **all existing SDK methods work without any changes**.

#### Usage

**Normal wallets** — no changes needed:

```typescript
const client = StoryClient.newClient({
  transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
  account: privateKeyToAccount("0x..."),
});
```

**ZeroDev AA wallet — Using Kernel Client directly (recommended)**:

ZeroDev's `createKernelAccountClient` returns a viem smart account client whose `writeContract` internally sends the UserOperation, waits for the bundler to include it on-chain, and returns the **real tx hash**. Therefore **`txHashResolver` is NOT needed** — simply pass the kernel client as the wallet:

```typescript
import { createKernelAccountClient } from "@zerodev/sdk";

const kernelClient = await createKernelAccountClient({ /* ... */ });

const client = StoryClient.newClientUseWallet({
  transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
  wallet: kernelClient,
  // No txHashResolver needed — kernel client handles it internally
});

// All SDK methods work as usual
const result = await client.ipAsset.mintAndRegisterIpAssetWithPilTerms({
  spgNftContract: "0x...",
  terms: [],
});
```

**Raw UserOp wallet + txHashResolver (for AA wallets that return userOpHash)**:

Some AA wallet integrations return the **UserOperation hash** directly from `writeContract` without internally waiting for the bundler receipt. For these wallets, configure `txHashResolver` to convert the userOpHash into the real on-chain tx hash:

```typescript
const client = StoryClient.newClientUseWallet({
  transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
  wallet: rawAAWallet, // writeContract returns userOpHash
  txHashResolver: async (userOpHash) => {
    const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
      hash: userOpHash,
    });
    return receipt.receipt.transactionHash;
  },
});
```

> **How to tell?** If the hash returned by the AA wallet's `writeContract` cannot be found as a transaction on a block explorer, it is a userOpHash and you need `txHashResolver`. If it can be found on-chain directly, the wallet already handles resolution internally and no resolver is needed.

**Dynamic Global Wallet**:

```typescript
const client = StoryClient.newClientUseWallet({
  transport: http("https://aeneid.storyrpc.io"),
  wallet: dynamicWalletClient,
  txHashResolver: async (userOpHash) => {
    // Use Dynamic's bundler client to resolve the hash
    const receipt = await dynamicBundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
      hash: userOpHash,
    });
    return receipt.receipt.transactionHash;
  },
});
```

#### Supported Factory Methods

`txHashResolver` is supported by all three client creation methods:

- `StoryClient.newClient({ ..., txHashResolver })`
- `StoryClient.newClientUseWallet({ ..., txHashResolver })`
- `StoryClient.newClientUseAccount({ ..., txHashResolver })`

#### API Reference

```typescript
/**
 * A function that resolves a hash returned by writeContract into an actual
 * transaction hash that can be used with waitForTransactionReceipt.
 *
 * @param hash - The hash returned by writeContract (could be a userOpHash or txHash)
 * @returns The resolved on-chain transaction hash
 */
type TxHashResolver = (hash: Hash) => Promise<Hash>;
```

## CI / Test Stability Improvements

This release also includes fixes for 5 flaky integration tests that were failing due to testnet timing and nonce contention issues. These failures were **pre-existing** and unrelated to the `txHashResolver` feature.

### Fix #1 — Dispute: `Assertion not expired`

**Root cause**: `settleAssertion` was called before the on-chain assertion liveness period had actually expired. The previous 3-second wait was insufficient given variable testnet block times.

**Fix**:
- `src/utils/oov3.ts` — `settleAssertion()` now retries up to 5 times (with 3s delay) when encountering `Assertion not expired`, instead of failing immediately.
- `test/integration/dispute.test.ts` — Increased the post-dispute wait from **3s → 15s** in both `beforeEach` and the multicall tagging test.
- `test/unit/utils/oov3.test.ts` — Added unit tests for retry success and max-retries failure; fixed `chai-as-promised` import.

### Fix #2–#4 — Group: `receiver IP not registered` + cascading failures

**Root cause**: Nonce contention from a shared test wallet caused intermittent transaction failures. When `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` failed in the "collect royalties" test, the subsequent "get claimable reward" and "claim reward" tests also failed because they depended on the state from the first test.

**Fix**:
- `test/integration/group.test.ts` — Added `this.retries(2)` to all three tests (`collect royalties`, `get claimable reward`, `claim reward`). Mocha will automatically retry each test up to 2 additional times on failure.

### Fix #5 — IP Asset: `replacement transaction underpriced`

**Root cause**: Nonce collision — a pending transaction from a previous test occupied the same nonce with equal or higher gas, causing the RPC node to reject the replacement.

**Fix**:
- `test/integration/ipAsset.test.ts` — Added `this.retries(2)` to the `should successfully register IP assets with multicall disabled` test.

### CI Workflow: `secrets: inherit`

- `.github/workflows/pr-internal.yml` — Changed from explicitly listing individual secrets to `secrets: inherit`, so all repository secrets (including `BUNDLER_RPC_URL`) are automatically forwarded to the reusable workflow.

## Test Coverage Notes

- **Unit tests**: Validate that `txHashResolver` is invoked before receipt polling and that the resolved hash is used for receipt lookup.
- **Integration tests — Pass-through & Simulated**: Cover normal wallet pass-through and simulated AA hash mapping behavior.
- **Integration tests — ZeroDev E2E (2 scenarios)**:
  - **Kernel client as wallet**: Verifies that `writeContract` returns a real txHash and the SDK works correctly without a resolver.
  - **Raw userOp wallet + txHashResolver**: Uses a custom wallet wrapper (whose `writeContract` returns a userOpHash) to verify end-to-end that the resolver converts the userOpHash into a real on-chain txHash.
- ZeroDev E2E tests require `BUNDLER_RPC_URL` and `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`. Tests are automatically skipped when these are not configured.
